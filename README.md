# CLI Env Toggler

WIP

Idea: Finds any ENV variables beginning with '###-{GROUP_NAME}' and enables them, inverting any that already are currently set to the '###-{GROUP_NAME}' state.

## Usage

Ensure you have Node installed, then run

```
npx cli-env-toggler
```
## Dev

```
npm run build && npm i -g
```

Then can do
```
npx env-toggler
```
